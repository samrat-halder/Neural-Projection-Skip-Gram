# Neural-Projection-Skip-Gram

This repository contains end-to-end implementation of NP-SG and DAN model. We first train a Neural Projection Skip-Gram model and then using the embeddings train a deep-average network for SST-fine classification task.

You need to set the input parameters for in `config.py`
